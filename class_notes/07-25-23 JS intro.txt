Computer: 
A computer is an electronic machine that is used to input, process, and then output data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program

    - machine 
    -transforms input to output
    -code 
    -data

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 --> base-10 number system 
    -binary code: ones and zeros
     - Known as base-2 number system 
        - 0 = ON  
        - 1 = OFF 
        -It is the machine language what computer understands
        -All the letters, digits, shapes and more are converted to binary code to be understood and processed
        by the computer.
    Computer is consist of software and hardware, CPU.
        Software: Operating systems (mac, windows) Microsoft office suite, Paint, applications.
        Hardware: Mouse, screen, printer, hard-disk

    -carry out sequences of logical operations


Binary Units:
Bits: one or zeros
Byte: 8bits (01100010)






MAC: cmd --> command
Windows: CTRL




Programming language:
-You can create applications
-communication with the machine 
-has rules (SYNTAX)
-Examples: JavaScript, Java, Go, Python, C# 

interpreted languages: JavaScript
compiled languages: lack ambiguity - confusion - conflict 

Compilation - compile - compiler  -> checking if your code is grammatically correct
execution - execute - executor   -> running the code 

INSTALL node.js and check the version
1. Download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Mac terinal and run   "node -v "

console.log()


"+" Operator
when used between strings = concatenation
Example: "hello" + "abc"  -> helloabc
        "123" + "12" -> 12312

when used between numbers (without quotes) = addition

Example1 + 2 = 3


When used between string and number = concatenation
Example: "John" + 45 -> John45

When used between number and string = concatenation
Example: 4 + "abc" -> 4abc
